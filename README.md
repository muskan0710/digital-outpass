Problem Statement/Motivation:
It's quite an harrassment for all the hostellers to get the form from the head caretaker's room, fill it and rush to the HOD and then the warden for approval a day or two before they are leaving for any outing more than a day. Not to forget that the HOD / warden may be busy or not present in their office and student might have to miss classes to get it approved.
Solution:
Digitalising the system by creating a website which has different login portals for different stakeholders' so students can fill up the form and get it approved online without having to rush to offices and waste time.
